# Rock, Paper, Scissors

This project is a solution to the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game challenge from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Overview

Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple hand game played between two players. The rules are straightforward:

- **Rock** crushes **Scissors**
- **Scissors** cuts **Paper**
- **Paper** covers **Rock**

In this project, you'll play against the computer, which makes its choices randomly. The game tracks wins, losses, and ties, providing an interactive and fun way to test your luck and strategy.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay:** Choose between rock, paper, or scissors and see immediate results.
- **Randomized Computer Choice:** The computer's move is randomly generated each round.
- **Score Tracking:** Keep track of wins, losses, and ties throughout the game.
- **Simple User Interface:** Designed to be clean and easy to use, whether in a browser or on the command line.
- **Educational Project:** Built as part of The Odin Project curriculum to help you learn fundamental programming concepts.
